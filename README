AQMAR Arabic Tagger

This package provides a sequence tagger implementation customized for Arabic features, 
including a named entity detection model especially intended for Arabic Wikipedia.
Learning is with the structured perceptron, optionally in a cost-augmented fashion.
Feature extraction is handled as a preprocessing step prior to learning/decoding.

The tagger was used for the experiments reported in

  Behrang Mohit, Nathan Schneider, Rishav Bhowmick, Kemal Oflazer, and Noah A. Smith (2012),
  Recall-Oriented Learning of Named Entities in Arabic Wikipedia. Proceedings of EACL.

and accompanies the AQMAR Arabic Wikipedia Named Entity Corpus also described in that work; 
both can be obtained at

  http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/AQMAR/

The Java tagger was adapted from Michael Heilman's supersense tagger implementation 
for English (http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/mheilman/questions/). It requires a minimum 
Java version of 1.6. Feature extraction uses Python and depends on the MADA toolkit 
(http://www1.ccls.columbia.edu/MADA/; version 3.1 was used for the Named Entity Corpus).

released in 2011 under GPL version 2 or later; the JSAP library, which we link to, was 
originally released by Martian Software in 2011 under the Lesser GNU Public License.)
