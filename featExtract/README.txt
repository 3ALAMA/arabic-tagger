Feature extraction for Arabic NER requires two files:
1. An NE tagged file (eg. sample.bio) in the standard BIO format (One token per line)
like the following:

word1 tag
word2 tag
..
..

2. The sample.mada file generated by the MADA 3.1 package (Habash et al
2010).  The pipline uses a MADA utility to extract features from the
.mada file.  For that you need to set the MADA_HOME variable to your
MADA directory

-----------------
In order to call the feature extractor use the following command:

./featExtract.sh sample

The file sample.bio.neFeats is the feature extracted file which can be
used by the NE tagger.

-----------------------
The feature extraction pipeline extracts affix, MADA and additional
lexical features from Arabic Wikipedia NE and Non-NE lexicons.  The
final feature file includes the following features


0. Token (T1,T2,...Tn-1, Tn)
1. T1
2. Tn
3. T1,T2
4. Tn-1,Tn
5. T1,T2,T3
6. Tn-2,Tn-1,Tn
7. T2,T3
8. Tn-2,Tn-1
9. T2,T3,T4
10. Tn-3,Tn-2,Tn-1
11. T3,T4
12. Tn-4,Tn-3
13. token length
14. is the word's gloss translation capitalized?
15. POS
16. case
17. aspect
18. number

23. is there a mada analysis
24. is the word Arabic UTF-8 (vs. Latin)
25. is base form same as the normalized form
26. Wikipedia: is this a hyperlink or regular text (noisy; turned off)
27. Wikipedia dict: noisy (noisy; turned off)
28. is the token utf-8 or ascii (noisy; turned off)

34. is curr+next token in Wiki non-NE dict
35. is curr+prev token in Wiki non-NE dict
36. class
